[DEPRECATED] This package is deprecated and no longer compatible with the CODDE Pi App.
Please consider using [CODDE Protocol](https://github.com/codde-pi/codde_protocol), enabling users to create their own tools in a dozen of python lines.

CODDE Manager allows SBCs to communicate with the CODDE Pi mobile application.
